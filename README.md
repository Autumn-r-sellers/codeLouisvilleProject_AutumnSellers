Clayton Pace Portfolio Website

Goals of this project:
1. Sell the world on Clayton Pace designs
2. Create an interesting user-interactive website for those interested in CP Designs
3. To test and improve my skills in the world of javascript and jQuery

Special Items to note on project:
1. The Louisville image changes based upon the time of day. To see the change, turn your computer time to 6:30AM and 6:30PM.
2. In mobile, when the louisville image is clicked on, it automatically navigates to the contact form.


Enjoy visiting the future, virtual world of CP Designs!
